Runner
    (double) Variables: x1, y1, x2, y2

        Greet the user upon code startup, and ask for 2 separate coordinate inputs.
        The Scanner class should be used to assign the appropriate coordinate points to variables.

        Using the substring method, check if each input is a valid coordinate, loop the code until it's valid.
        With valid inputs, use the substring method to assign the coordinates to the appropriate x and y variable.
        (Convert from String to double, coordinates can have decimals)

        Create a LinearEquation object with the variables.

        Run the each method, and then call toString to see the data.

LinearEquation
    (double) Class Variables: x1, y1, x2, y2

    Import DecimalFormat with layout "0.00" to round all numbers to the nearest 100th

    Methods:

        (constructor) LinearEquation(x1, y1, x2, y2):
            The constructor will assign the corresponding variables to each other, to then use in other methods.

        (double) distance():
            This will calculate the distance between the points, and return the double of the distance.


        (String) distanceToString(String demicalOrFraction):
            Returns the actual formula for distance as a String, with the variables filled in.
            Either decimals or fractions should be printed based on what the user inputs.


        (double) slope:
            This will calculate the slope of the two points, and return the double of the slope.


        (String) slopeToString(String demicalOrFraction):
            Returns the actual formula for slope as a String, with variables filled in.
            Either decimals or fractions should be printed based on what the user inputs.

        (double) yIntercept:
            This will return the y-intercept of the two points as a double.

        (String) yInterceptToString(String demicalOrFraction):
            Returns the actual formula for y-intercept, with variables filed in.
            Either decimals or fractions should be printed based on what the user inputs.


        (String) toString(String demicalOrFraction):
            This method will combine all of the main method data types, into one String which is returned.
            Return the inputed coordinates as part of the String as well.
